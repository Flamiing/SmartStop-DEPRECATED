### <p align="center">Smart Stop is a program that lets you stop WSL by just typing 'smart-stop' in the terminal!</p>

---
**What it does?**</br>
Smart Stop will stop **ALL** the WSL services including the distros running in the background and the IDE that you specified in the settings as it is needed for the WSL service to not autorestart and close the `Vmmem` process.</br>

---
## 🛠️Requirements

  
 - **Compatible WSL distros:**<br/>
	  	✔️ Ubuntu<br/> 		 
	  	✔️ Debian<br/> 		 
	  	✔️ kali-linux<br/> 		 
	  	✔️ Ubuntu-16.04<br/> 		 
	  	✔️ Ubuntu-18.04<br/> 		 
	  	✔️ Ubuntu-20.04<br/>


 - **Install dpkg if not installed**
	
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install dpkg

## ⚙️Installation

*IMPORTANT: All the installation is made from the WSL Terminal you want the program to be installed and used.* </br>
</br>
 1. **Download the package:**
	 
		wget https://github.com/Flamiing/SmartStop/releases/download/v1.0.0/Smart_Stop_1.0_amd64.deb
 2. **Install the package:**

		sudo dpkg -i Smart_Stop_1.0_amd64.deb

 3. **Setup your preferences:**
 
	Set the distro in which you are installing Smart Stop by copying your distro name from the compatible distros section above and changing it for `DistroName`.

		smart-stop -d DistroName
	Set your IDE with the below command. Change `IDEName` by the process name of the IDE you use without the [filename extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension#:~:text=A%20filename%20extension%2C%20file%20name,md%20). <br/>
	If you don't know how to find a process name [click here](https://docs.celonis.com/en/how-to-discover-a-process-name-for-a-specific-application.html).

		smart-stop -i IDEName
		
	If you use _**Windows Terminal**_ and don’t want it to be closed you can set the option off by typing:

		smart-stop -t false
	If you change your mind you can just type:

		smart-stop -t true

## 💡TIPS

Sometimes it can happen that WSL auto restarts when opening the file explorer(not sure why), to avoid this i recommend you typing this command into Powershell with admin rights:</br>

	dism.exe /online /disable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /norestart
	
If you want to revert the changes you can do it with this other command:

	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

## ⚡Usage

After everything is setup you can use `smart-stop` to close WSL and relax!<br/>
You can check at any time the list of available commands by typing `smart-stop -?` or `smart-stop --help`
